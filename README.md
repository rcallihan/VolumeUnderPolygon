VolumeUnderPolygon
==============

Measures volume underneath polygon, above DEM. This method differs from Arc's Polygon Volume tool because it assumes no polygon elevation and instead overlays the polygon over the DEM. The script accepts one or many polygons in a shp. The calculated volume value is assigned as an attribute in the shp's table.
